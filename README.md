# Basic Forum Software to Practice Webdev
This is a very basic forum software. It supports making threads and posting to threads. You probably shouldn't use it for anything, but it *does* work.

Currently it does not have any protection against fast posting/spamming.

All posts can use markdown. Some elements (like h1) may render strangely.

To use it, just add it to your django apps. It's that easy! The only depedency is python markdown.
